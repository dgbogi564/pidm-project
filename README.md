<p>We are Group 12 and this is our Auction Project! It features a functioning admin page and regular Auction site. However, due to the limitation of a team of 3 instead of the original 4, we weren't able to get customer representative functions up that was originally divided for the 4th partner. We hope this is put into consideration for the missing parts. Thank you! </p>
